heyyyyy biggest fear is
- heights
 _ ***standing on a very tall place scary. Thinking and worrying about the potential agony of falling from a great height may contribute to the development of acrophobia. Researchers believe that a bad or traumatic event with a significant height may contribute to a person acquiring acrophobia. However, for me I don't remember falling or my fear being from a traumatic event. I just remember always being scared and not liking it***.
